# 🦅 IMPORTANT: Place Your Eagle Image

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your eagle image** (the one with blue jacket and orange scarf)
2. **Name it:** `eagle-avatar.jpg`
3. **Place it in:** `public/eagle-avatar.jpg`

## Using File Manager:
- Drag and drop the image into the `public` folder
- Rename it to `eagle-avatar.jpg`
- Replace the existing placeholder file

## Using Terminal:
```bash
# If your image is on desktop:
cp ~/Desktop/your-eagle-image.jpg public/eagle-avatar.jpg

# Or drag the image into the public folder and rename it
```

The image will automatically appear in the Hero section! ✨
